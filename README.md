# Financial Planning

creating two financial analysis tools:

1) a personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.

2) a retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then running Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years.
